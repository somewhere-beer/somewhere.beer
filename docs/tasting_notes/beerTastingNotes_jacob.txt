Drake's 1500:
Smooth at first with a hint of sweetness. Ends with a non-intrusive hoppy flavor. Overall a light tasting beer that goes down easy.
Le Freak:
No real discernible smell as well as lacking in overall flavor. Hints of alcohol linger on the finish around the middle of the tongue. Hops didn't really punch through as much as expected from an IPA, although the flavor does linger relatively long.
Evil Twin:
Very smooth tasting beer as a whole. Chocolatey tones are more prevalent rather than the hops and there may be a very slight hint of citrus.
Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout:
The flavor profile starts with a little chocolatey taste; however the malty flavor stands out a bit more as the lasting impression. I would consider this to be an overall smooth tasting beer with no overpowering tones.
