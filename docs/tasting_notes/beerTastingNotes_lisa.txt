Elysian Space Dust IPA:
Rich and smooth, well-balanced hops but with a fresh appealing bite.  Medium-bodied and clean on the finish.
North Coast Beachmaster Imperial IPA:
Very light on carbonation, near malty but with clarity. Almost sweet with notes of chocolate, leaves you thirsting for more.
Mai Tai IPA:
A Sauv Blanc of beers, fruity and light. Almost no flavor on the nose but goes down easy.
Knee Deep Simtra IPA:
Oaty, even-keeled and hoppy without a bite. Strong on the palette, if light on the nose and finish.
Bubble Bath Berliner Weisse:
A sour weisse, light and hazy. A unique fruity flavor remniscent of a peach creamsicle.
Heretic Evil Twin Red IPA:
Light-bodied with a dark flavor. Hints of malt, barley, and caramel.  Very filling, a real sipper.
History Lesson Pilsner:
Hazy, watery with no real flavor - punch of pils flavor almost ghostly. Not a favorite.
Roast It Note Nitro Porter:
Nearly flat - very light on nitro.  Rich, earthy, dark and tending toward a sour flavor. Almost meaty.
