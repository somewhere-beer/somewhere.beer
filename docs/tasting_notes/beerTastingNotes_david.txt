Drake's 1500:

Notes of grapefruit on the nose. A quick hit of wheat up front yields to a long, hoppy finish.

Le Freak:

Floral, fruity hints on the front end. Not especially hoppy, despite its high IBU. The high ABV leaves you with a lingering finish dominated by alcohol.

Heretic Evil Twin:

Notes of chocolate and citrus on the nose. The predominantly malt-based flavor profile is surprisingly light for an IPA.

Anderson Valley:

Opens up with notes of cacao, coffee, and red berries. Finishes on a smooth malt note.
