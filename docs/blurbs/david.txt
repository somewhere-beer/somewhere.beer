I'm a former startup operations guy who decided to make the jump over to the engineering side of things. I'm actively looking for junior-level web development opportunities, especially with stacks using Python. When it comes to drinks, I'm more of a wine and whiskey kind of guy, but I've been known to enjoy an amber ale or IPA from time to time.
