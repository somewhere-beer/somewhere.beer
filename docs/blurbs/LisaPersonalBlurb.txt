I'm a beginnig programmer interested in entering the world of computing, studying Java and Sustainability part-time and working full-time in the catering industry. I enjoy fresh, hoppy beers as well as a few smoother flavors and the occasional crisp, light-bodied beer. I'm interested in ecologically-minded breweries and foreign breweries.
