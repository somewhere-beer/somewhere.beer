I'm a full-time computer science student working towards entry level web-development oportunities. I like both working with my hands and making things in software because the results can improve quality of life and you're able to enjoy the fruits of your labors first hand, be it software or a coffee table. I helped with some of the visual elements on the site, specifically the colors and the logo design. When it comes to beer, you might find me having a pale ale, a stout, or a hefeweizen with no real heirarchy between them. I'm usually trying new brews and comparing more so than having my tried and true flavors that keep me coming back.
