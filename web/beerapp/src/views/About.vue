            <h2>Thomas</h2>
            <p>I am a Linux-loving, self-proclaimed code monkey (mostly writing java these days), home-brewer, and all around techie nerd. For this project I focussed on the backend writing both the HTTP api access and acting as the DBA.
              As far as beer preferences I tend to go for dark beers and IPAs for the most part. With that said there are few beers that I would call truly bad, and to quote my dad “... , and most of them are from Texas”

            <p>I'm a beginning programmer interested in entering the world of computing, studying Java and Sustainability part-time and working full-time in the catering industry. I enjoy fresh, hoppy beers as well as a few smoother flavors and the occasional crisp, light-bodied beer. I'm interested in ecologically-minded breweries and foreign breweries.

            <h2>David</h2>
            <p>I'm a former startup operations guy who decided to make the jump over to the engineering side of things. I'm actively looking for junior-level web development opportunities, especially with stacks using Python. When it comes to drinks, I'm more of a wine and whiskey kind of guy, but I've been known to enjoy an amber ale or IPA from time to time.

        <h2>Maayan</h2>
        <p>I am a full-stack developer who develop web application for small and big companies, professionals and start-up companies.
            Now days I am a student who takes some courses in the Computer Science field.
            I enjoy trying the local beer in every place I am travelling to. I prefer the light beers with no fruity taste.</p>

        <p>
          I'm a full-time computer science student working towards entry level web-development oportunities.
          I like both working with my hands and making things in software because the results can improve quality of
          life and you're able to enjoy the fruits of your labors first hand, be it software or a coffee table.
          I helped with some of the visual elements on the site, specifically the colors and the logo design.
          When it comes to beer, you might find me having a pale ale, a stout, or a hefeweizen with no real heirarchy
          between them. I'm usually trying new brews and comparing more so than having my tried and true flavors that
          keep me coming back.
